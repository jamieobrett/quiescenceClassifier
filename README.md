These are R scripts that accompany that manuscript, "An artificial niche preserves the quiescence of muscle stem cells and enhances their therapeutic efficacy" (https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3576).

Included are visualization scripts (Dendrogram.R, Heatmap.R, PCADensityPlot.R, PCAPlot.R) and statistical scripts using random forests to predict cell state (conditionalRF.R, cRFpermute.R).

These scripts are designed to be opened with a text editor, edited (input file names, etc.), and used interactively with an R session.

These scripts depend on the following R packages:
	party
	languageR
	rms
	e1071
	pvclust
	ape
	MASS
	RColorBrewer
	wordcloud
	TeachingDemos
	MetabolAnalyze
	ade4
	flexclust
